### Project Title: Real time Bus Tracker

### Description of Project 
##### This project demonstrates how asynchronous functions operate. The goal of the project is to track the location of a bus on Bostonâ€™s MBTA route 1 in real-time. The project required the use of two APIs. The first one integrates JavaScript with the MapBox library to display a map. The second API also integrates JavaScript with the MBTA v3 API to pull the schema for vehicles and plot the location of each active bus on the map. Launch the application and the buses' location will update every 15 seconds.

### How to run this project.
##### You can fork this repo to your GitHub account. You can copy and download the repo to your PC by clicking on the green code button and selecting Download ZIP or you can run the project from the landing or project page.

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
##### Instead of hard coding the bus number into the MBTA API, I'd like to add a validated input field to select the bus number. Also, I would like to add a popup for each buses icon and add attributes about the bus that are available in the API. See a part of the schema below.
